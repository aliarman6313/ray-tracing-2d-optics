# Ray Tracing 2D - Optics Simulation

This is a basic 2D ray tracing simulation using Snell's Law to visualize the behavior of light at the interface of two different optical media.

---

## 🔍 Description

- Simulates the refraction (or total internal reflection) of a light ray across a flat boundary.
- Uses Snell’s Law to compute the transmitted angle.
- Visualizes incident and refracted rays in a 2D diagram.
- Highlights total internal reflection when it occurs.
