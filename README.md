# 2D Ray Tracing in Optics

This project simulates the path of a light ray hitting the interface between two media with different refractive indices using Snell's Law.

## Features
- Calculates refraction or total internal reflection
- Visualizes incident and refracted rays in 2D
- Uses Python with matplotlib and numpy

## Example Output

## Requirements
`bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
